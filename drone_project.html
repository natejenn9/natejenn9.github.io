          This project involved building and fine-tuning drones from scratch. Using Betaflight CLI, extensive scripting was implemented to fine-tune parameters such as PID tuning, motor outputs, and calibrations. The project required iterative testing to optimize flight controllers, ESCs, motors, and sensors, demonstrating strong problem-solving and analytical skills.

          The real challenge was hardware-software integration. Firmware was coordinated with real-time sensor inputs from gyroscopes and accelerometers, ensuring smooth flight performance. This project not only showcased technical expertise but also emphasized resilience and attention to detail in resolving complex flight issues.
